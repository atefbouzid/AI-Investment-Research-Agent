## 📊 Database Schema

### Reports Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE reports (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    session_id UUID REFERENCES analysis_sessions(id),
    ticker VARCHAR(10),
    company_name VARCHAR(255),
    report_type VARCHAR(10), -- 'pdf' or 'latex'
    filename VARCHAR(255),
    file_content BYTEA,      -- Binary PDF data
    file_size BIGINT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    expires_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT (NOW() + INTERVAL '5 days')
);
```

## 🔄 Complete Workflow

### 1. Analysis Generation
```
User Request → Generate Report → Save to Database → Delete Local File → Return report_id
```

### 2. View Reports
```
User visits /reports → Fetch from database → Display cards → Click View → Open PDF viewer
```

### 3. Download Reports
```
Click Download → Fetch from database → Stream file → Browser download
```

### 4. Delete Reports
```
Click Delete → Confirm → Delete from database → Update UI → Free space
```

## 🛠️ How to Test

### 1. Generate New Analysis
```bash
# Run analysis (authenticated)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/analyze \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"ticker": "AAPL", "report_format": "pdf"}'
```

### 2. View Reports
